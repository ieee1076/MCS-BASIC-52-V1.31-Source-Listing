         The programme  Terminal-MCS-51  is a terminal-programme for MS-DOS 
         computers, which  has  been  particular written for the using with 
         MCS-51-BASIC   computers.  It  offers  you  the   possibility   of 
         comfortable MCS-51-BASIC programme  development with the following 
         capacity:

          - Easy loading and saving of MCS-51-BASIC-programmes
          - Renumbering of MCS-51-BASIC-programmes 
            (only in registered version)  
          - Comfortable MCS-51-BASIC-line-editor
          - Arbitrary ASCII-editor easy to integrate

         Terminal-MCS-51 needs the following minimal Hardware-requirements:

          - A MS-DOS-computer
          - Any video-card
          - A floppy- or hard-disk
          - A serial interface (COM1: or COM2:)
          - A MSC-51-BASIC-system (conected to the serial interface)

          MCS-51-BASIC
          ------------
         The MCS-51-BASIC-interpreter  has  been  developed  by the company 
         INTEL  particularly  for the  8052-AH microcontroler and fits with 
         its size of only 8 Kbyte into  the internal read only memory (ROM) 
         of this processor. Meanwhile INTELฎ had placed this interpreter as 
         freeware in the public  domain  and  the  commented sourcecode and 
         HEX-file  can  be  found in the Internet! But also the interpreter 
         can  copy  itself with a MCS-51-BASIC-programme out of an existing 
         8052-AH  into  an  EPROM.  This  copy  will  then  also run with a 
         reasonable 8032-CPU. I  have  developed  a  MCS-51-BASIC-computer, 
         using  a  80C52  CPU which has been published in the electronics & 
         computer  magazine  "ELEKTOR",  edition  2/98 and 3/98. The sum of 
         commands  of  MCS-51-BASIC  is  a  bit  reduced  in  the   string-
         processing,  but  still  comfortabele.  Unfortunately  the command 
         RENUM  for  renumbering  the  MCS-51-BASIC-linenumbers  have  been 
         economized. The MCS-51-BASIC-line-editor makes only the delete of 
         the last character of the lineinput possible.
